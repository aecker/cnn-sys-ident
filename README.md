# CNN-based system identification

This repository contains tools for fitting CNNs to neural responses. 

Many of the basic database design patterns are stolen from Fabi's https://github.com/cajal/cortex_ex_machina

My older code can be found in https://github.com/cajal/cnn-rf-model – but this repo has become too much of a mess.
